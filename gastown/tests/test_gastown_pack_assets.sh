# Five role-surfaces resolve a work bead from the environment, by deliberately
# different rules, and the differences are load-bearing. Two properties decide
# which form is safe -- NOT "pooled vs singleton": the refinery and the deacon
# carry identical max_active_sessions = 1 + wake_mode = "fresh" pins, so pooling
# cannot tell them apart. What differs is (a) whether more than one session
# shares the env, and (b) whether the role rotates wisps IN-SESSION, which makes
# a spawn-fixed trigger go stale mid-loop:
#   shutdown dance (dog pool, max_active_sessions = 3) - resolve the CLAIM
#     first. The spawn trigger is fixed at wake and is not advanced by
#     `gc hook --claim`, so under contention it names a bead this session never
#     claimed - and the dance closes whatever it resolves.
#   deacon patrol formula (singleton, wake_mode = "fresh", pours the next wisp
#     then EXITS the turn) - may prefer the trigger: one process env holds
#     exactly one wisp for its whole life.
#   refinery patrol formula (singleton too, but re-reads the formula steps
#     in-session after burning) - bare ${GC_BEAD_ID:-} plus a live assignee
#     query, never the trigger: the wisp advances while the trigger does not.
#   refinery / witness / deacon prompt templates - bare ${GC_BEAD_ID:-} plus the
#     same live query. Exempt from the trigger rule by form, not by luck: a bare
#     resolution backed by the assignee query cannot mis-select on any role, so
#     it stays correct even on the singletons. Pinned below so the exemption is
