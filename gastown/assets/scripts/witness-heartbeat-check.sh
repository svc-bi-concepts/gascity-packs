# witness-heartbeat-check.sh — deterministic staleness check for witness patrol
# loops. Read-only: it measures, prints, and exits. It never mails, nudges, or
# files warrants — the deacon's health-scan step owns those decisions.
#
# The gap it closes: a witness whose self-scheduled patrol loop has died still
# reports a healthy session state. It sits in `asleep` or `active` forever, so
# the controller's liveness reconcile sees nothing wrong and the deacon's
# LLM health-scan reads the quiet as legitimate idle. Patrol stalls of 14h to
# 63h were observed in production this way with no alert. Heartbeat age is the
# one signal that separates "idle and fine" from "loop is gone", and it is
# exactly the kind of measurement an LLM should not be eyeballing.
#
# For every witness session in a state that implies it should be patrolling
# (active / awake / asleep / running) it takes the NEWER of `last_active` and
# `last_nudge_delivered_at` as the heartbeat and compares its age against
# $GASTOWN_WITNESS_STALE_MIN. Sessions the controller or an operator owns
# (creating / start-pending / drained / draining / suspended / quarantined /
# stopped / closed) are the controller's business and are skipped. Terminal
# sessions are derived from `state` — the current `gc session list --json`
# schema no longer exposes a `closed` field (gc-3tn8g).
#
# Output: one TSV row per checked witness on stdout, column header on stderr.
#
#   verdict <TAB> rig <TAB> session <TAB> state <TAB> age_seconds <TAB> heartbeat
#
#   fresh        heartbeat inside the window
#   stalled      heartbeat older than the window — the patrol loop is gone
#   no-heartbeat session records no usable timestamp yet (see below)
#   schema-drift session exposes no `last_active` at all — nothing was measured
#
# Exit codes:  0 = every checked witness is fresh (or none to check)
#              1 = findings on stdout (stalled and/or no-heartbeat)
#              2 = the check could not run (bad env, unreadable roster, or a
#                  `gc session list` schema drift that hid `last_active`)
#
# A `no-heartbeat` witness is deliberately NOT reported as stalled. `gc` emits
# the Go zero-time sentinel (0001-01-01T00:00:00Z) for a timestamp it has never
# set, and a naive parse of that turns a brand-new witness into a false stall.
# It is still a finding rather than silence, because an unset heartbeat means
# nothing was measured — it must never read as health.
#
# Env:
#   GC_CITY                    city root (auto-discovered if unset, walks up)
#   GASTOWN_WITNESS_STALE_MIN  staleness window in minutes (default: 90)
#   GASTOWN_WITNESS_ROLE       role suffix to match (default: witness)
#
# Usage:
#   witness-heartbeat-check.sh
#   GASTOWN_WITNESS_STALE_MIN=45 witness-heartbeat-check.sh
#
# The heartbeat-freshness idea comes from gascity-packs PR #99 by
# sarendipitee, which added it as "Check 1b" to a watchdog in the retired
# maintenance pack.
